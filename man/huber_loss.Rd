\usage{
huber_loss(err, k)
}
\description{
Huber loss function. (quadratic at first, then become linear).
Note that you need to have an estimate of the residual's standard deviation (call it sigma_hat)
to set the parameter k, which determines where the loss function is quadratic and where it is not
typical values for k, which provide high efficiency also in the normal case, are then 
k = sigma_hat * 1.345
